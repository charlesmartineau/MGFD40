# Objective
The objective of this course is to provide 4th year undergraduate students in business school with an understanding of deviations from the standard asset pricing models and their implications for investment decisions. The course will cover key topics in behavioral finance, asset pricing models, market efficiency, and empirical asset pricing.

## Proposed Course Structure

### Class 1: Introduction to Behavioral Finance & Decision-Making Under Uncertainty
**Classical Finance Benchmark:**
- Expected Utility Theory (von Neumann-Morgenstern)
- Rational investor assumptions
- Standard portfolio theory basics

**Empirical Evidence (Classical):**
- Experimental evidence supporting expected utility in simple settings
- Early portfolio choice studies

**Behavioral Challenge:**
- Prospect Theory (Kahneman & Tversky, 1979)
- Loss aversion and reference dependence
- Framing effects
- Probability weighting and certainty effect

**Empirical Evidence (Behavioral):**
- Experimental violations of expected utility
- Disposition effect in trading behavior
- Equity premium puzzle as potential manifestation
- Myopic loss aversion experiments

### Class 2: Individual Biases and Retail Trading Behavior
**Classical Finance Benchmark:**
- Rational expectations and Bayesian updating
- Efficient information processing
- Optimal portfolio diversification

**Empirical Evidence (Classical):**
- Early evidence of seemingly rational trading patterns
- Diversification benefits in practice

**Behavioral Challenge:**
- Overconfidence (overestimation, overplacement, overprecision)
- Confirmation bias and self-attribution bias
- Representativeness heuristic
- Anchoring and availability bias
- Mental accounting

**Empirical Evidence (Behavioral):**
- Excessive trading volume (Odean, 1999; Barber & Odean, 2000)
- Gender differences in overconfidence and trading
- Under-diversification and home bias
- Attention-driven trading
- Return chasing behavior

---

### Class 3: CAPM and Cross-Sectional Asset Pricing
**Classical Finance Benchmark:**
- Capital Asset Pricing Model (Sharpe, Lintner, Mossin)
- Mean-variance efficiency
- Market portfolio as optimal portfolio
- Single-factor pricing: E[Ri] = Rf + βi(E[Rm] - Rf)

**Empirical Evidence (Classical):**
- Early tests supporting CAPM (Black, Jensen, Scholes, 1972)
- Market beta as risk measure

**Behavioral Challenge:**
- Systematic mispricing due to behavioral biases
- Size effect (small firms outperform)
- Value effect (high B/M outperforms)
- Behavioral explanations: extrapolation, representativeness
- Limits to arbitrage preventing correction

**Empirical Evidence (Behavioral):**
- Fama-French three-factor model (1993) - size and value factors
- Long-term reversal of extreme performers
- Lottery-like stock preferences
- Low-volatility anomaly
- Behavioral interpretations of factor premia

---

### Class 4: Market Efficiency and Event Studies
**Classical Finance Benchmark:**
- Efficient Market Hypothesis (Fama, 1970)
- Three forms: weak, semi-strong, strong
- Random walk hypothesis
- Event study methodology assuming efficient incorporation of information

**Empirical Evidence (Classical):**
- Early event studies showing rapid price adjustment
- Variance ratio tests supporting random walk
- Market responds to earnings announcements

**Behavioral Challenge:**
- Under-reaction to information (conservatism bias)
- Over-reaction to salient information (representativeness)
- Delayed incorporation of information
- Post-earnings announcement drift (PEAD)
- Herding and information cascades

**Empirical Evidence (Behavioral):**
- Post-earnings announcement drift (Bernard & Thomas, 1989)
- Momentum in stock returns (Jegadeesh & Titman, 1993)
- Under-reaction to analyst revisions
- Over-reaction to news and long-term reversal
- Delayed response to fundamental information

---

### Class 5: Return Predictability
**Classical Finance Benchmark:**
- Unpredictability of returns under EMH
- Risk-based explanations for predictability
- Rational time-varying expected returns
- Dividend discount model implications

**Empirical Evidence (Classical):**
- Predictability from dividend yield (Campbell & Shiller)
- Business cycle variation in risk premia
- Term structure and default spread as rational predictors

**Behavioral Challenge:**
- Sentiment-driven mispricing
- Extrapolation of past performance
- Investor overreaction and correction cycles
- Survey-based sentiment measures
- Market timing behavior

**Empirical Evidence (Behavioral):**
- Shiller's excess volatility puzzle
- Predictability from investor sentiment indices
- Closed-end fund puzzle and sentiment
- IPO waves and subsequent underperformance
- Aggregate investor flow patterns
- Variance decomposition showing noise trader risk

---

### Class 6: Momentum and Reversal
**Classical Finance Benchmark:**
- CAPM implies no momentum or reversal after risk adjustment
- Random walk in returns
- Any patterns should be risk-compensated

**Empirical Evidence (Classical):**
- Attempts to explain momentum with risk factors
- Conditional CAPM tests

**Behavioral Challenge:**
- Under-reaction and delayed over-reaction (Hong & Stein, 1999)
- Momentum: continuation of returns at 3-12 month horizon
- Long-term reversal: reversal at 3-5 year horizon
- Representativeness and conservatism as driving forces
- Self-attribution bias reinforcing trends

**Empirical Evidence (Behavioral):**
- Medium-term momentum (Jegadeesh & Titman, 1993)
- Long-term reversal (DeBondt & Thaler, 1985)
- Industry momentum
- International evidence of momentum
- Momentum crashes during market rebounds
- Gradual information diffusion models
- Limits to arbitrage in momentum strategies

---

### Class 7: Liquidity, Transaction Costs, and Limits to Arbitrage
**Classical Finance Benchmark:**
- Law of one price
- Arbitrage ensures prices reflect fundamentals
- Perfect capital markets assumptions
- Frictionless trading

**Empirical Evidence (Classical):**
- Arbitrage eliminates mispricings in simple settings
- Put-call parity holds in liquid options markets
- Law of one price in currency markets (covered interest parity)

**Behavioral Challenge:**
- Limits to arbitrage (Shleifer & Vishny, 1997)
- Noise trader risk and synchronization risk
- Implementation costs limit arbitrage
- Short-sale constraints
- Agency problems in delegated portfolio management
- Why don't smart money eliminate anomalies?

**Empirical Evidence (Behavioral):**
- Twin shares pricing deviations (Royal Dutch/Shell)
- Index inclusion effects
- Closed-end fund discounts
- Persistence of anomalies despite publication
- Liquidity premia beyond risk-based explanations
- Transaction costs and limits to momentum/value strategies
- Short-sale constraints and overpricing
- Fire sales and liquidation value
- Failure of convergence in arbitrage opportunities
