## Recap: Evidence of Anomalies
::: {style="height: 1em;"}
:::

We have seen evidence that certain strategies earn abnormal returns:

- **Momentum**: Buy past winners, sell past losers → positive returns
- **Contrarian**: Buy past losers, sell past winners → positive returns (longer horizons)

[Harvey, Liu, and Zhu (2016)](http://www.aea.ru/data/pdf/campbell.pdf) document that "...there are now more than 300 documented anomalies."

These strategies use **long-short portfolios** to isolate the effect.

**Key question**: Are these returns *compensation for risk*, or evidence of *market inefficiency* caused by some behavioral bias?

## Anomaly or Risk Factor?
::: {style="height: 2em;"}
:::

When we observe that a strategy earns positive returns, two interpretations:

**Risk-Based Explanation:**

- The strategy is exposed to systematic risk
- Returns are compensation for bearing that risk
- Investors require higher returns for holding risky assets

**Behavioral/Mispricing Explanation:**

- Markets are inefficient
- Investors make systematic errors
- Returns are "free lunch" (until arbitraged away)

## How to Distinguish Risk from Mispricing?
::: {style="height: 1em;"}
:::

**Evidence for RISK:**

- ✓ Returns covary with bad economic states (recessions, crises)
- ✓ Strategy is painful to hold when you need money most
- ✓ Persistent across time periods and markets
- ✓ Clear economic rationale for the risk

**Evidence for MISPRICING:**

- ✓ Linked to documented behavioral biases
- ✓ Limits to arbitrage prevent correction
- ✓ Varies with investor sentiment/attention
- ✓ Diminishes after publication (arbitraged away)

## Testing Anomalies: The Methodology
::: {style="height: 1em;"}
:::

**Step 1:** Form long-short portfolios based on the characteristic

- Sort stocks into deciles/quintiles
- Go long top decile, short bottom decile
- Track returns over time

**Step 2:** Regress portfolio returns on factor models

$$R_{LS,t} - R_f = \alpha + \beta_1 (R_m - R_f) + \beta_2 SMB + \beta_3 HML + \epsilon_t$$

**Step 3:** Examine the alpha (intercept)

- Significant $\alpha > 0$ → anomaly not explained by model
- $\alpha \approx 0$ → returns explained by factor exposures

## Factor Models: From CAPM to Multi-Factor
::: {style="height: 1em;"}
:::

**CAPM (1 factor):**
$$E(R_i) - R_f = \beta_i (E(R_m) - R_f)$$

**Fama-French 3-Factor (1993):**
$$E(R_i) - R_f = \beta_{MKT}(R_m - R_f) + \beta_{SMB} \cdot SMB + \beta_{HML} \cdot HML$$

Each additional factor potentially "explains away" anomalies.

## What Are These Factors?
::: {style="height: 1em;"}
:::

| Factor | Construction | Interpretation |
|--------|--------------|----------------|
| **MKT-RF** | Market return minus risk-free | Equity risk premium |
| **SMB** | Small minus Big (size) | Small firm risk |
| **HML** | High minus Low (B/M) | Value/distress risk |

All factors are **long-short portfolios** themselves!

## Interpreting Regression Output
::: {style="height: 1em;"}
:::

Example regression output for an hypothetical momentum strategy:

| Coefficient | Estimate | t-stat |
|-------------|----------|--------|
| Alpha | 0.50% | 2.45 |
| MKT-RF | 0.05 | 0.82 |
| SMB | -0.15 | -1.91 |
| HML | -0.42 | -3.67 |

**Interpretation:**

- **Alpha = 0.50%**: Monthly abnormal return not explained by factors
- **MKT-RF ≈ 0**: Little market exposure (market neutral)
- **SMB < 0**: Tilts toward large caps
- **HML < 0**: Tilts toward growth (momentum loads negatively on value)

## What Does Alpha Tell Us?
::: {style="height: 2em;"}
:::

**Significant positive alpha:**

- The anomaly generates returns beyond factor exposures
- Either: (1) missing risk factor, or (2) true mispricing

**Alpha ≈ 0:**

- Factor model "explains" the anomaly
- Returns are compensation for factor exposures
- Not necessarily "free money"

**But**: Explaining ≠ Understanding

- Saying "momentum is explained by HML loading" doesn't tell us WHY


## Real Example: Media Coverage Anomaly
::: {style="height: 1em;"}
:::

[Fang and Peress (2009)](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1540-6261.2009.01493.x?casa_token=w2rYYekmgB0AAAAA%3AQg2eWRKBIyM8ZyGbPuThAiPnEszKAygMLU2--wrUg2renEg6gLDP2Wle20pEoFj91r7nM8wtwBBrJi4) find that stocks with low media coverage earn higher returns.

**Strategy:** Long low-coverage stocks, short high-coverage stocks

![](figures/fang.png){width=80%, .center}


**Interpretation:** Alpha shrinks but remains marginally significant. Some of the effect is explained by size/value/momentum, but not fully. This could be a risk factor (e.g., illiquidity) or mispricing (neglected stocks). Its up to the authors to make the case.

## The Joint Hypothesis Problem
::: {style="height: 2em;"}
:::

[Fama (1970)](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2325486?casa_token=5LwsiVj8NS4AAAAA%3A_1laeZh-bmCY0nq5gVUUpGBdjJ-fuiOEQ7LmUdMIGTNzmN1xj4xrBgNtaguAw4seQetevB63j1ybU9a5Dn1lpJntC568LXV3tLmmfkUP_F4bznlzhL_K): "Tests of market efficiency are joint tests of:

1. The efficiency hypothesis, AND
2. A particular asset-pricing model"

**Implication:** When we find significant alpha, we cannot tell if:

- Markets are **inefficient** (mispricing), OR
- Our **model is wrong** (missing risk factor)

This is the fundamental identification problem in empirical asset pricing.

## The Joint Hypothesis in Practice
::: {style="height: 1em;"}
:::

**Scenario:** You find a strategy with significant CAPM alpha.

**Interpretation A (Mispricing):**

- "CAPM is correct, markets are inefficient"
- Behavioral biases create exploitable patterns

**Interpretation B (Risk):**

- "Markets are efficient, CAPM is incomplete"
- The strategy captures a missing risk factor
- Add the factor to the model (SMB, HML, etc.)

**Reality:** We can never fully resolve this. The debate continues.

## Do Anomalies Survive Publication?
::: {style="height: 1em;"}
:::

If anomalies reflect mispricing, arbitrageurs should trade them away once known.

**Key finding:** Many anomalies weaken significantly after publication.

| Study | Finding |

| [Schwert (2003)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/chapter/handbook/abs/pii/S1574010203010240) | Size, value, weekend effects weakened after discovery |
| [Chordia et al. (2014)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165410114000275?casa_token=bMCOJbsOp3kAAAAA:WEodC3OXjDn6eRfJoe7pMqxYnC0QK5th5zO5aNLEZo0CXWRT33PS69poGllHj6IDeTBVNjSD3Ro) | Short-term reversals disappeared due to algorithmic trading |
| [Martineau (2022)](https://www.emerald.com/cfr/article-abstract/11/3-4/613/1324916/Rest-in-Peace-Post-Earnings-Announcement-Drift) | Post-earnings announcement drift gradually disappeared over time|

**Implication:** Post-publication decay supports the mispricing view—informed traders arbitrage away the profits.

## Why Do Some Anomalies Persist?

Not all anomalies disappear. Persistence may indicate:

**1. Limits to Arbitrage** (Shleifer & Vishny, 1997)

- Transaction costs, short-selling constraints
- Idiosyncratic risk deters arbitrageurs
- Noise trader risk

**2. Continued Behavioral Biases**

- New investors keep making the same mistakes
- Institutional constraints prevent exploitation

**3. Compensation for Risk**

- If it's truly a risk factor, returns should persist
- No "free lunch" to arbitrage away

**Key insight:** Anomalies that persist despite publication *might suggest* that they are more likely risk-based.

## Summary: How to Think About Anomalies
::: {style="height: 1em;"}
:::

1. **Document the anomaly** using long-short portfolios

2. **Test against factor models** to see if alpha persists

3. **Consider both explanations:**
   - Risk: Does it hurt in bad times? Economic rationale?
   - Mispricing: Behavioral bias? Limits to arbitrage?

4. **Remember the joint hypothesis:**
   - Rejection of a model ≠ market inefficiency
   - Could be a missing factor, i.e., you don't have the right asset pricing model!

5. **Beware of data mining:** 300+ anomalies suggests many are spurious
