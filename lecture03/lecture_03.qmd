## Herbert Simon

:::{.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
Simon (1955) introduced the concept of **bounded rationality** to describe the limitations of human decision-making.

  - Individuals are rational within limits imposed by cognitive constraints.
  - I.e., people try to make rational decisions, but their ability to do so is limited by limited information and limited cognitive processing power.
  - Created the first AI program, Logical Theorist.

:::{.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
They introduced the concept of **heuristics and biases** to explain how people make decisions under uncertainty.

  - Heuristics are mental shortcuts that simplify decision-making.
  - While heuristics can be useful, they can also lead to systematic errors or biases in judgment.

# Heuristic-Driven Bias Process

## Heuristic-Driven Bias Process

::: {style="height: 2em;"}
:::

People develop general principles as they find things out for themselves.

- They rely on heuristics (i.e., rules of thumb) to draw inferences from the information at their disposal.

- Heuristics are not bad things; they often make sense and simplify and speed up decision-making process.

- People are susceptible to particular errors because the heuristics they use are oversimplified and imperfect and people actually commit errors in particular situations.

Can you think of a simple example of heuristics?

## Common Cognitive Biases

::: {style="height: 2em;"}
:::


1. **Availability/familiarity heuristics**: Overestimating the importance of information that is readily available.
2. **Naive Diversification heuristic**: The tendency to spread investments evenly across available options.
3. **Representativeness Heuristic**: Judging the likelihood of an event based on how similar it is to a prototype.
4. **Anchoring Bias**: Relying too heavily on the first piece of information encountered.
5. **Overconfidence Bias**: Overestimating one's own abilities or knowledge.

---

## Availability/Familiarity Heuristic

::: {style="height: 2em;"}
:::

If a random word is taken from an English text or English dictionary, is it more likely that the word starts with a K, or that K is the third letter?

- Choice A: The word starts with a K
- Choice B: The word with K as the third letter

- Choice A: Gun homicide
- Choice B: Kidney disease

## Availability/Familiarity Heuristic

::: {style="height: 2em;"}
:::

<u>Availability heuristic definition</u>:

- A cognitive illusion where you misjudge the frequency of some event or characteristic because of how much you can remember seeing it. 

- *It’s a sampling error*: you may think that your memory provides an adequate sample of the whole, and sometimes it might, but often it won’t.

- For example, one may assess the divorce rate in a given community by recalling divorces among one’s acquaintances 

$\Rightarrow$ The sample that you see is not representative of the true population.

::: {style="height: 1em;"}
:::

<u>Familiarity heuristic definition</u>:

- People are more comfortable with the familiar.
- Also, these people dislike ambiguity and look for ways to avoid unrewarded risk.
- Related to “home bias" when it comes to investment which impacts diversification.

### Implications of Availability/Familiarity Heuristic in Finance

::: {style="height: 2em;"}
:::

<u>Home bias</u>:

- The tendency for investors to favor companies from their own town / country or for whom they work for when constructing their investment portfolios.

[Benartzi (2000)](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/0022-1082.00388?casa_token=MNQlNtJh9rIAAAAA%3ALgrOUa6xgl3QVMlblrkGZRBP8DWq388Suo6N4oyBB8QyC4GoK6d-4JeCcfEmGCo6gwR4G666jTBvvLw_) find that employees of a large US company allocate on average 1/3 of their 401(k) plan contributions to their employer's stock, despite the lack of diversification and higher risk associated with such a strategy.

  - Employees of firms that experienced the worst stock performance over the last 10 years allocate ~10% percent of their discretionary contributions to company stock, whereas employees, whose firms experienced the best stock performance allocate ~40%.
  - Allocations to company stock do not predict future performance.

Can you think of a famous investor who exhibited home bias?

## Coval and Moskowitz (2002): Local Equity Preference

[Coval and Moskowitz (2002)](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/0022-1082.00181?casa_token=EPa8gofN7vAAAAAA%3As-IJmaixyLMIMhjMVEc_ieI6Ccordo6HudKMOqaWb6LwtbttRAB5DQoxh7GchrBTZeq7oplvScrcvg) examines the phenomenon of "local equity preference" among fund managers in the United States.

### Coval and Moskowitz (2002)

- Investors hold a disproportionate share of their portfolios in local stocks, i.e., stocks of companies headquartered in the same state as the investor.
- This local bias is particularly pronounced among individual investors and mutual fund managers.
- The authors suggest that local investors may have better information about local companies, leading to superior investment performance.
  - Better information because they managers' local holdings tend to be in small, nontraded-goods-producing firms with high degree of financial leverage.

- This finding challenges the traditional finance theory that investors should diversify their portfolios globally to minimize risk.


---

## Naive Diversification Heuristic

::: {style="height: 3em;"}
:::

**Definition:**

 - When asked to make several choices at once, people tend to diversify more than when making the same type of decision sequentially.
 - E.g., when people choose now which of six snacks to consume in the next three weeks, they tend to seek more variety (e.g., pick more kinds of snacks) than when they make sequential choices (e.g., choose once a week which of six snacks to consume that week for three weeks).


---

### Implications of Naive Diversification Heuristic in Finance

::: {style="height: 3em;"}
:::

In Benartzi and Thaler (2001), the authors find investors divide their contributions evenly across the funds offered in their contribution plan. 

- They did diversify. Is this good or bad? It depends on how the information is presented to them.
- The authors survey employees of a corporation and ask about their portfolio allocation choices over a stock fund, bond fund, and balance fund (both stocks and bonds).
- The find that when employees simply naively diversify, they end up with suboptimal allocations, i.e., too much in bonds and too little in stocks or vice versa, depending on how the options are presented to them.

Main results from Benartzi and Thaler (2001)

- When choosing between stocks and balanced fund, employees allocate 66% to stocks.
- When choosing between bonds and balanced fund, employees allocate 34% to stocks.

## Representativeness Heuristic

::: {style="height: 2em;"}
:::


**Definition:** the tendency to judge the likelihood of object (A) or event belongs to a specific class (M) by the degree to which (A) resembles (M).

 - In other words, people tend to assess similarity and make predictions based on how much one thing resembles another.
 - People make judgments based on stereotypes.
  
Not all bad... the advantage of representativeness is that it allows us to make quick decisions without having to analyze all available information.

  - E.g., when we hear a big noise, we try to run away from the source of the sound.

Disadvantages:

- Base rate neglect  
- Sample size neglect 
- Gambler’s fallacy

- Linda is 31, single, outspoken and very bright. She majored in philosophy. As a student, she was deeply concerned with issues surrounding equality and discrimination. Is it more likely that Linda is:
  - A bank teller
  - A bank teller and active in the feminist movement

## Representativeness Heuristic Experiments: Sample size neglect

::: {style="height: 2em;"}
:::

A certain town is served by two hospitals. In the larger hospital about 100 babies are born each day, and in the smaller hospital about 25 babies are born each day. 

- As you know, about 50% of all babies are boys. However, the exact percentage varies from day to day. Sometimes it may be higher than 50%, sometimes lower. 
- From a period of one year, each hospital recorded the days on which more than 60% of the babies born were boys. 
 
Which hospital do you think recorded more such days?

- The larger hospital
- The smaller hospital
- About the same

Which of the following sequences is more likely to occur when a fair coin is tossed?

- H-H-H-T-T-T
- H-T-H-T-T-H

If six tosses of a coin all turn out to be heads, H-H-H-H-H-H, which do you bet on the seventh toss?

- Head (H)
- Tail (T)


---

## Implications of Representativeness Heuristic in Finance

::: {style="height: 2em;"}
:::

Investors are subject to representativeness bias 

 - They may believe that a stock that has performed well in the past will continue to do so in the future, leading to overconfidence in their investment choices. 
   - Investors forget that stock returns, on average, are mean-reverting in the long run.
 - Investors may also neglect the base rates of stock performance, leading them to make investment decisions based on recent trends rather than long-term averages.
 - Investors see trends where none exist... E.g., technical analysis. The trend might just be random noise.
   - When someone tries to convince you that a stock is going to go up because of some pattern they see in the stock chart; ask them, "can you convince me that this pattern has any predictive power beyond random chance?"

## Anchoring Bias

::: {style="height: 2em;"}
:::

Estimate the product of the following equation without actual calculation:

- 1 x 2 x 3 x 4 x 5 x 6 x 7 x 8 = ?

---

## Anchoring Bias

::: {style="height: 2em;"}
:::

Estimate the product of the following equation without actual calculation:

- 8 x 7 x 6 x 5 x 4 x 3 x 2 x 1 = ?

---

## Anchoring Bias

::: {style="height: 2em;"}
:::

**Definition:** the common human tendency to rely too heavily on the first piece of information offered (the "anchor") when making decisions.

- In the above example, the order of the numbers served as an anchor that influenced the estimates.
- When the smaller numbers were presented first, people tended to give lower estimates, and when the larger numbers were presented first, people tended to give higher estimates.
- This bias can lead to suboptimal decision-making, as individuals may not adequately adjust their estimates away from the anchor.

## Implications of Anchoring Bias in Finance

::: {style="height: 2em;"}
:::

George and Hwang (2004) find that:

- Traders appear to use the 52-week high (low) as a reference point against which they evaluate the potential impact of news. When good (bad) news has pushed a stock's price near or to a new 52-week high (low), traders are reluctant to bid the price of the stock higher (lower) even if the information warrants it.
- The authors attribute their findings to slow reaction to news and to anchoring bias (more on this later in the course).
- Helps to explain momentum in prices (more on this later in the course).

---


## Overconfidence Bias

::: {style="height: 2em;"}
:::

**Definition:** unwarranted faith in one’s intuitive reasoning, judgments, and cognitive abilities.

- Overconfidence is a cognitive bias that can be exacerbated by heuristics, but it's not itself a heuristic.
- Subjects overestimate both their own predictive abilities and precision of information they have been given.
- People think that they are smarter and have better information than they actually do.
- Think of all the "planning fallacy" ... "it will only take me 2 hours to finish this project" ... "I will only need $5000 to start my business" ...


---

## Overconfidence Bias Examples

::: {style="height: 2em;"}
:::

You are asked to participate a gamble against one of your classmate. 

- Both you and your classmate will put X dollars into the gamble. Your classmate will toss a coin.
- If it is a head, you get 2X dollars and your classmate gets 0; if it is a tail, you get 0 dollars and your classmate gets 2X.
- How much are you willing to bet in this gamble?

Now the rule of the gamble stays exactly the same. The only difference is that you will toss the coin.

- How much are you willing to bet in this gamble?

Overconfidence leads to an illusion of control when people are given the opportunity to make choices that affect outcomes.

## Implications for retail investors: Overconfidence Bias

::: {style="height: 2em;"}
:::

Overconfidence bias has significant implications for retail investors, often leading to suboptimal investment decisions.

- Overconfident investors may trade excessively, believing they can time the market or pick winning stocks more accurately than they actually can.
- They may underestimate risks, leading to portfolios that are not well-diversified.
- Overconfidence can also lead to a lack of learning from past mistakes, as investors may attribute successes to their skill and failures to external factors.


---

## Overconfidence of Retail Investors

::: {style="height: 2em;"}
:::

[Barber and Odean (2000, JF)](https://faculty.haas.berkeley.edu/odean/papers%20current%20versions/individual_investor_performance_final.pdf) find that individuals and institutions trade much more than can be justified on rational grounds.

--- 

## Overconfidence Bias for Retail Investors


![](figures/barber.png){top=50 width=70%}

- After taking trading costs into account, the average return of investors is well below the return of standard benchmarks, largely due to transaction costs.
- Those that trade most earn an annual return of 11.4%, while the market returns 17.9%.
- "Trading is hazardous to your wealth!"

---

## Overconfidence Bias for Retail Investors

In [Barber and Odean (2002)](https://faculty.haas.berkeley.edu/odean/papers%20current%20versions/online%20rfs.pdf), analyze 1,607 investors who switched from phone-based to online trading during the 1990s.

Going online leads to substantial decrease in net returns due to increased trading.

## Attention-induced trading

Investors have time to weigh the merits of only a limited number of stocks. Why do they consider some stocks and not others?

[Barber and Odean (2008)](https://academic.oup.com/rfs/article-abstract/21/2/785/1607197) show that individual investors are net buyers of attention-grabbing stocks, e.g., stocks in the news, stocks experiencing high abnormal trading volume, and stocks with extreme one-day returns.

- Individual investors do not face the same search problem when selling because they tend to sell only stocks they already own. 
- Thus, attention-induced trading should predominantly affect purchase rather than sale decisions—retail investors can buy any stock that captures their attention but can only sell stocks that they own 

## Attention-induced trading

Results from Barber and Odean (2008)

![](figures/allthatglitter.png)

Note: Buy-Sell imbalance is measured as (Buys - Sells) / (Buys + Sells). It's a buy/sell pressure indicator.

## Robinhood Effect

[Barber et al. (2022)](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1111/jofi.13183) find that Robinhood attracts more inexperienced, overconfident, and attention-grabbing retail investors.

- Especially the feature of "most popular stocks" on the app interface attracts even more attention-grabbing retail investors.

## StockTwits

In [my own research](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4439793), I find that social media attention before earnings announcements is excessively optimistic, fails to predict fundamentals, and generates buying pressure, leading to a 58 bps stock return as intermediaries seek higher returns to mitigate inventory risk.

- Social media like StockTwits attracts attention-grabbing retail investors that distorts price efficiency.

## StockTwits' sentiment

![](figures/stocktwits_sentiment.png)

- Sentiment is overly optimistic before earnings announcements, even for "sophisticated" traders.
