    "# Python Assignment\n",
    "\n",
    "**Due date**: February 28. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Submission guidelines**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Submit your assignment through Quercus.\n",
    "- Only submit your Jupyter Notebook file (`.ipynb`).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Student Name:** [Your Full Name]  \n",
    "**Student ID:** [Your Student ID]  \n",
    "**Date:** [Submission Date]  \n",
    "**Course:** MGFD40 – Investor Psychology  \n",
    "\n",
    "# Instructions\n",
    "- **Stock Tickers:** See `student_assignments.csv` for your assigned stock tickers (you can use these tickers directly with yfinance), matched by your name and student number. For more details about each ticker, see `stock_ticker_details.csv`. \n",
    "- Coding Questions: Implement the trading strategy **exactly as described** in the assignment prompt.\n",
    "- Written Questions: Answer the question clearly and concisely. \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Grading:** 75% code (correctness + clarity), 25% reflection (quality + authenticity).\n",
    "- Use Python and any necessary standard libraries (e.g., pandas, numpy, matplotlib).\n",
    "- Your code must be:\n",
    "  - Clearly structured\n",
    "  - Appropriately commented to explain logic and key steps (comments contribute to code clarity and may support your reflection)\n",
    "- AI tools are allowed to assist with the coding process, but you must understand and be able to explain your implementation.\n",
    "- Written responses should be concise and directly answer the question.\n",
    "  - **Do not use AI for written / reflection questions.** They must be written in your own words.\n",
    "  - You may use Markdown cells or `print()` statements where appropriate.\n",
    "- Submit **one** Jupyter Notebook file (`.ipynb`) **only**. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Execution Requirements\n",
    "- The notebook must run **from top to bottom without errors** on a fresh kernel (restart + run all). Debug thoroughly before submitting.\n",
    "- All required inputs, intermediate steps, and final outputs must be visible in the notebook.\n",
    "- Do **not** assume any external files, paths, or prior execution state unless explicitly instructed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Failure to meet these requirements may result in mark deductions.\n",
