  "# Python Assignment\n",
  "\n",
  "Due date: the day before your midterm exam. Submit your assignment through Quercus.\n",
  "\n",
  "**Student Name:** [Your Full Name]  \n",
  "**Student ID:** [Your Student ID]  \n",
  "**Date:** [Submission Date]  \n",
  "**Course:** MGFD40 – Investor Psychology  \n",
  "\n",
  "# Instructions\n",
  "- Implement the trading strategy **exactly as described** in the assignment prompt.\n",
  "- **Grading:** 80% code (correctness + clarity), 20% reflection (quality + authenticity).\n",
  "- Use Python and any necessary standard libraries (e.g., pandas, numpy, matplotlib).\n",
  "- Your code must be:\n",
  "  - Clearly structured\n",
  "  - Appropriately commented to explain logic and key steps (comments contribute to code clarity and may support your reflection)\n",
  "- AI tools are allowed to assist with the coding process, but you must understand and be able to explain your implementation.\n",
  "- Written responses should be concise and directly answer the question.\n",
  "  - **Do not use AI for reflection questions.** Reflections must be written in your own words.\n",
  "  - You may use Markdown cells or `print()` statements where appropriate.\n",
  "- Submit **one** Jupyter Notebook file (`.ipynb`) only.\n",
  "\n",
  "## Execution Requirements\n",
  "- The notebook must run **from top to bottom without errors** on a fresh kernel (restart + run all). Debug thoroughly before submitting.\n",
  "- All required inputs, intermediate steps, and final outputs must be visible in the notebook.\n",
  "- Do **not** assume any external files, paths, or prior execution state unless explicitly instructed.\n",
  "\n",
  "Failure to meet these requirements may result in mark deductions.\n",
